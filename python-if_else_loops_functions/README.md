## Tasks

### [0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/0-positive_or_negative.py)
- This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the `number` stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

### [1. The last digit](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/1-last_digit.py)
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the `number` stored in the variable number.

### [2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. ](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/2-print_alphabet.py)
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### [3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/3-print_alphabt.py)
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
- Print all the letters except q and e
- You can only use one print function with string format
- You can only use one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module

### [4. Hexadecimal printing](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/4-print_hexa.py)
Write a program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)

### [5. 00...99](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/5-print_comb2.py)
Write a program that prints numbers from `0` to `99`.

- Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
- The last number should be followed by a new line
- You can only use no more than 2 `print` functions with string format
- You can only use one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module

### [6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials.](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/6-print_comb3.py)
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

- Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
- The two digits must be different
- `01` and `10` are considered the same combination of the two digits `0` and `1`
- Print only the smallest combination of two digits
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
- The last number should be followed by a new line
- You can only use no more than 3 `print` functions with string format
- You can only use no more than 2 loops in your code
- You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module

### [7. islower](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/7-islower.py)
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

- Prototype: ```def islower(c):```
- Returns `True` if `c` is lowercase
- Returns `False` otherwise
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are not allowed to use `str.upper()` and `str.isupper()`
- `Tips: ord()`

### [8. To uppercase](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/8-uppercase.py)
Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

- Prototype: ```def uppercase(str):```
- You can only use no more than 2 `print` functions with string format
- You can only use one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are not allowed to use `str.upper()` and `str.isupper()`
- `Tips: ord()`

### [9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/9-print_last_digit.py)
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

- Prototype: ```def print_last_digit(number):```
- Returns the value of the last digit
- You are not allowed to import any module

### [10. a + b](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/10-add.py)
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

- Prototype: ```def add(a, b):```
- Returns the value of `a + b`
- You are not allowed to import any module

### [11. a ^ b](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/11-pow.py)
Write a function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and return the value.

- Prototype: ```def pow(a, b):```
- Returns the value of `a ^ b`
- You are not allowed to import any module

### [12. Fizz Buzz](https://github.com/WennieL/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/python-if_else_loops_functions/12-fizzbuzz.py)
